# ML code and notes
The code that I practiced (after learning) and some math notes.

## Code:
This repo is the culmination of whatever I've learnt in ML using the 2 books "Introduction to Statistical Learning", and "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"

## Theory:
Mostly from the book ISLR.
- detailed notes with images and references if used any

#### NOTE!!:
- Deep Learning code and notes have not yet been documented and arranged properly, will be uploaded soon!
- Formatting errors and some images are not displaying :(
