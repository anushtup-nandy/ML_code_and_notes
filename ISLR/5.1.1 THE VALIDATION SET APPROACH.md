### 5.1.1 THE VALIDATION SET APPROACH;
This involves breakin the available dataset into a *training set* and a *validation set* where a validation set means that it's to be **hold-out**.
Training-set--> model is fit
validation set--> model is used to predict this.

Validation set error rate is found using the MSE (Mean Squared Error)

It is easy to implement and understand. But it has 2 problems:
1. Error rate can be highly variable depending on the data included.
2. only a subset of the observation are included in the training set rather than in the validation set. Since statistical methods tend to perform worse when trained on fewer observations, this suggests that the validation set error rate may tend to overestimate the test error rate for the model fit on the entire data set.

>usually the training and validation sets are of comparable sizes like ~1/2 of the total dataset
