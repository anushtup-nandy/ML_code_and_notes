### 5.1.4 BIAS-VARIANCE TRADE-OFF FOR K-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION;
>K-fold cross-validation often gives more accurate results than LOOCV

| LOOCV                                                                                                                        | K-fold                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| n times                                                                                                                      | k(<n) times                                   |
| Much more computationally intensive                                                                                          | Less intensive                                |
| More or less un-biased due it it being on n-1 obs                                                                            | moderately biased due to it being on (k-1)n/k |
| More variance due to high correlation (we are performing averaging on outputs of n-fitted models which are almost identical) | Lesser varaince, due to lesser correlation.(smaller samples)                                              |
