### 9.1.1 WHAT'S A HYPERPLANE:
>In a p dimensional space, a hyperplane is a *flat affine subspace* of dimension p-1. Like in 2D, a hyperplane will be a 1D line.

equation of a Hyperplane in p-dimensions:
$$
\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+...+\beta_pX_p=0----(9.1)
$$
if it's $\geq,\leq$ 0, then we can say that $X=(X_1,...X_p)^T$ lies on ONE-SIDE of that hyperplane.
