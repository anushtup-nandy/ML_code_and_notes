from: [[4.2.2 LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS FOR p greater than 1]]
to: [[4.2.4 NAIVE BAYES]]

### 4.2.3 QUADRATIC DISCRIMINANT ANALLYSIS:
Assumes that the classes are drawn from a [[NORmal distribution]] / [[Multivariate Gaussian distribution]]. But it takes into account that the classes might have their own [[Covariance Matrix]] (i.e., different ones).

Under this the [[2.2.4 THE BAYES CLASSIFIER]] assigns an observation X=x to the class for which:
$$
\delta_k(x)=\frac{-1}{2}(x-\mu_k)^{T}{{\sum}^{-1}_{k}}{(x-\mu_{k)}}-\frac{-1}{2}log|{\sum}_{k}|+ log{\pi_k}----(4.21)
$$
is largest.
Basically, the QDA is: plugging the estimates, ${\sum}_{k}, \mu_{k},\text{and } \pi_{k}$ into (4.21) and then assigning X=x to the class for which the quantity is largest.

>[!note]
>x in QDA is a quadratic function.

#### WHICH TO CHOOSE? LDA VS QDA:
Depends on the [[2.2.2 BIAS-VARIANCE TRADE-OFF]].
*For every p predictors, we need to estimate: p(p+1)/2 parameters!*
QDA estimates a different one for each: i.e., k(p)(p+1)/2 parameters (covariance matrices)
