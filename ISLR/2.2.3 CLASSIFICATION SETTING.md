### 2.2.3 CLASSIFICATION SETTING:
The most common approach for quantifying the accuracy of our estimate $\hat{f}$ is the training error rate, the proportion of mistakes that are made if we apply error rate our estimate ˆf to the training observations:

$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}I(y_{i}\neq \hat{y}_i)----(2.8)
$$

Here **ˆyi** is the predicted class label for the ith observation using **ˆf**. And $I(yi \neq ˆyi)$ is an indicator variable that **equals 1 if $yi \neq ˆyi$ and zero if $yi = ˆyi$** . indicator variable If $I(yi \neq ˆyi) = 0$ then the ith observation was classified correctly by our classification method; otherwise it was misclassified.
The test error rate:

$$
Ave(I(y_{0}\neq \hat{y}_i))----(2.9)
$$
