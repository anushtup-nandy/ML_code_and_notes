### 5.2.1 WHAT WE DO IN BOOTSTRAP:
Suppose we have a dataset--> Z. We randomly select n observations from the dataset, and we produce a boostrap dataset--> $Z^{*1}$. This occurs with **REPLACEMENT**, basically the same observation can occur more than once in a boostrap dataset.

We use this to generate $\hat\alpha^{*1}$. This entire process is repeated B different times (large B)--> B estimates of both $Z^{*1}$ and $\hat{\alpha^{*1}}$.  Then we compute the SE of the boostrap estimates:
$$
SE_B(\hat\alpha)=\sqrt{\frac{1}{B-1}\sum\limits_{r=1}^B(\hat\alpha^{*r}-\frac{1}{B}\sum\limits_{r'=1}^B\hat\alpha^{*r'})}----(5.6)
$$
