to: [[4.1.5 MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION]]

### 4.1.4 MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION:
Now we move on to multiple predictors (earlier we only had 1: balance).

The new **LOGIT:**
$$
log(\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)})= \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + · · · + \beta_pX_p----(4.6)
$$
And hence, the probability function will be: 
$$
\text{LOGISTIC FUNCTION : }p(X) = \frac{e^{β0+β1X1+···+βpXp}}{1 + e^{β0+β1X1+···+βpXp}}----(4.7)
$$
*TABLE 4.3*

| Name          | coefficient | Std.Error | z-statistic | p-value |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Students(YES) | -0.6468     | 0.2362    | -2.74       | 0.0062  |
| Balance       | 0.0057      | 0.0002    | 24.74       | <0.0001 |
| intercept     | -10.8694    | 0.4923    | -22.08      | <0.0001 |
| income        | 0.0030      | 0.0082    | 0.37        | 0.7115        |
Student here is a dummy variable. 
<u>Explainantion</u>:
The p-value associated with balance and the dummy variable for student status are very small, indicating that each of these variables is associated with the probability of default.
However, the coefficient for the dummy variable is negative, indicating that students are less likely to default than nonstudents.
There is different coefficients in *TABLE 4.2* AND *TABLE 4.3*  for the **student(YES)**. We are supposed to follow the one with multiple predictors (the one we described here). This indicates that:  
>for a fixed value of balance and income, a student is less likely to default than a non-student

==CONFOUNDING:==

The results obtained using one predictor may be quite different from those obtained using multiple predictors, especially when there is correlation among the predictors. In general, the phenomenon seen in Figure 4.3 is known as confounding.
