### 2.2.2 BIAS-VARIANCE TRADE-OFF:
$$
E(y_{0}-\hat{f}(x_{0}))^{2} = Var(\hat{f}(x_0)) + [Bias(\hat{f}(x_{0))]^2}+Var(\epsilon)----(2.7)
$$
Variance refers to the amount by which Ë†f would change if we estimated it using a different training data set.
Bias refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model. 

>[!important]
>As a general rule, as we use more flexible methods, the variance will increase and the bias will decrease
