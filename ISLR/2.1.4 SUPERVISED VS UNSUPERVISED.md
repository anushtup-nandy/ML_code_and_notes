### 2.1.4 SUPERVISED VS UNSUPERVISED:
#### 2.1.4.1 SUPERVISED:
For each observation of the predictor measurement(s) xi , i = 1, . . . , n there is an associated response measurement yi . We wish to fit a model that relates the response to the predictors, with the aim of accurately predicting the response for future observations (prediction) or better understanding the relationship between the response and the predictors (inference).

#### 2.1.4.2 UNSUPERVISED:
unsupervised learning describes the somewhat more challenging situation in which for every observation i = 1, . . . , n, we observe a vector of measurements $x_i$ but no associated response $y_i$ . It is not possible to fit a linear regression model, since there is no response variable to predict. In this setting, we are in some sense working blind; the situation is referred to as unsupervised because we lack a response variable that can supervise our analysis.
