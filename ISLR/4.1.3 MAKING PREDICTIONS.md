### 4.1.3 MAKING PREDICTIONS:
We can use the coefients in  *TABLE 4.1* and put in (4.2) to get ouor estimates for any balance.

One can use qualitative predictors with the logistic regression model using the <u>dummy variable approach</u>.
To fit a model that uses student status as a predictor variable, we simply create a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 for students and 0 for non-students.

*TABLE 4.2a*

| Name                 | coefficient | Std.Error | z-statistic | p-value |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Students(X)          | 0.4049      | 0.1150    | 3.52        | 0.0004  |
| Intercept($\beta_0$) | -3.5041     | 0.0707    | -49.55      | <0,0001 |

<u>Explanination</u>: Here we can see that although the coefficients are +ve and signigficant, so is the p-value, telling us that students have higher defaults than non-students.
