### 4.1.2 ESTIMATING THE REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS:
We could use the least squares method to FIT this model (4.4) but we prefer to MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD.
We seek estimates for β0 and β1 such that the predicted probability ˆp(xi) of default for each individual, using (4.2), corresponds as closely as possible to the individual’s observed default status.

THE LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION:
$$
l(\beta_{o}, \beta_1)=\prod_{i:y_i=1}p(x_{i}) \prod_{i':y'_i=0}(1-p(x'_i))----(4.5)
$$
***Estimates are chosen to maximise this likelihood function!***
They've stated here using a table that: 
*TABLE 4.1*

| Name                 | coefficient | Std.Error | z-statistic | p-value |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Balance(X)           | 0.0055      | 0.0002    | 24.9        | <0.0001 |
| Intercept($\beta_0$) | -10.6513    | 0.3612    | -29.5       | <0,0001 |

<u>Explainantion</u>:
For instance, the z-statistic associated with β1 is equal to $\hat{\beta_1}/SE(\hat{\beta_1} 1)$ , and so a large (absolute) value of the z-statistic indicates evidence against the null hypothesis ***H0 : β1 = 0***. This null hypothesis implies that $p(X) = e^{β_{0}}/(1+e^{β_0})$ : in other words, that the probability of default does not depend on balance. Since the p-value associated with balance in Table 4.1 is tiny, we can reject H0.
