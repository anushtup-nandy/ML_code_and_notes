### 3.3.2 EXTENSIONS OF THE LINEAR MODEL:
The general linear regression model (3.11 [[CH-3 CLASSIFICATION]]) is restrictive although it is applicabe in lots of areas.
Some of the assumptions that it made are:
- Additive
- Linear 

##### additive:
$X_j$ and $Y$ association do not depend on the other $X's$ .

#### Removing the additive assumption:
Look to [[INTERACTION EFFECT]] between the different predictors.
The same model (3.11) with interaction effect between $X_1,X_2$ will be:
$$
\begin{gather*}
Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+\beta_3X_1X_2+\epsilon----(3.16)\\
Y=\beta_0+(\beta_1+\beta_3X_2)X_1+\beta_2X_2+\epsilon\\
Y=\beta_0+\tilde{\beta_1}X_1+\beta_2X_2+\epsilon
\end{gather*}
$$
Check the [[3.1.3 ASSESSING THE ACCURACY OF THE  MODEL]] ($R^2$ and other statistisc to get too know if the model is correct).

>[!important]
>**HEIRARCHIAL PRINCIPLE:** If we include an interaction in a model, we shoould also include the main-effects(og model assumtions).
>basically, if we end up finding a relationship between X1 and X2, then include both.

#### Non-linear Relationships:
We can include polynomial functions of the predictors in the regression model ( #polynomial_regression )
Like:
$$
Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_1^2
$$
is just another linear regression with a polynomial power of X1.
