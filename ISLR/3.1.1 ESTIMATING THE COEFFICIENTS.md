### 3.1.1 ESTIMATING THE COEFFICIENTS:
We need data to estimate the coefficients. The data is usually available in pairs of $(x_i,y_i)$-> (predictor, response)
>Estimation is done to makesure that the model we've selected fits the data well. I.E., we need CLOSENESS of the predictions to the real values to make sure that the error is less

Most common method of measuring closeness is LEAST SQUARES criterion.
Let the below showed function be the prediction for Y based on ith X:
$$
\hat y_i=\hat \beta_{0}+ \hat \beta_{1}x_i
$$
then $e_i=y_{i}-\hat{y_i}$ represents the ==RESIDUAL==

##### rss (residual sum of squares):
$$
\begin{gather*}
RSS=e_1^2+..........+e_{n}^2\\
RSS={(y_1-\hat \beta_{0}+ \hat \beta_{1}x_{1})^2}+......+{(y_n-\hat \beta_{0}+ \hat \beta_{1}x_{n})^2}----(3.3)
\end{gather*}
$$
**Least sqaures approach aims to MINIMISE the RSS**
