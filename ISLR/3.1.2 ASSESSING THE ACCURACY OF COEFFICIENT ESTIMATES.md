### 3.1.2 ASSESSING THE ACCURACY OF COEFFICIENT ESTIMATES:
In linear regression we assume that the relationship between the predictors and the response is:
$$
Y=f(X)+\epsilon----(3.5)
$$
where the $\epsilon$ is a *mean-zero random error term*.
Assume that this error term is independent of X

equation (3.5) is the best estimate, and equation $Y=\beta_0+\beta_{1}{X}+\epsilon$ is the **POPULATION REGRESSION LINE**, which is the BEST LINEAR approximation to the true relationship.

In real world, we can assume that we won't get the population regression line. So we estimate using a number of LEAST SQUARES lines (as shown in light blue).

>[!important]
>Fundamentally, the concept of these two lines is a natural extension of the standard statistical approach of using information from a sample to estimate characteristics of a large population.

#### bias vs unbaised:
The thing with only using 1 estimate from 1 sample population is that it may be biased--> may overfit, underfit, etc
But, if we could average it out over a number of sample populations. Then we can say that it may not *systematically overfit/underfit* the true parameter.

##### standard error:
It is the measure of *HOW FAR IS THAT SINGLE ESTIMATE FROM THE TRUE ONE?*
$$
Var(\hat \mu)=SE(\hat \mu)^2=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}----(3.6)
$$
We can interpolat this to a SIMPLE Linear Regression:
![[Pasted image 20220724113111.png]]----(3.7)

For this to be valid, we need to assume that the errors $\epsilon_i$ have a common variance $\sigma^2$ and are un-correlated (check [[Covariance Matrix]])
#### RSE:
In general $\sigma$ us not known, so we use something called a RESIDUAL STANDARD ERROR (RSE):
$$
RSE=\sqrt{RSS/(n-2)}----(3.8)
$$
- These further can be used to compute the [[CONFIDENCE INTERVALS]] .
	- <u>The 95% CI for the parameters in a simple linear regression</u>

- We can also compute [[HYPOTHESIS TESTS]]:
	- Most common one being the NULL hypothesis
	- ![[Pasted image 20220724123617.png]]
	- We ususally use the t-statistic to find if our prediction is sufficiently far from 0

	- We can also use the p-value to determine this (the confidence interval)
		- if the p value is small, then there is a relation, otherwise not.
