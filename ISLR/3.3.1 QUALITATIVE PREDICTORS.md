### 3.3.1 QUALITATIVE PREDICTORS:
Variables can be of 2 types:
- Quantitative
- Qualitative

#### Predictors with only 2 levels:
Basically 2 levels means that it can only hold 2 possible values. Like *those who do and those who don't*. (check out [[4.1.3 MAKING PREDICTIONS]], and [[4.1.4 MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION]] for more examples)

This is also mostly done for QUALITATIVE predictors(*factors*).

We create a **Dummy variable** that takes on 2 possible numerical values.
$$
x_i=\Biggl\{\begin{gather*}1, \text{ if ith person has it}\\0, \text{ if ith person does not have it}\end{gather*}
$$
which might result in something like:
$$
y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+\epsilon_i=\Biggl\{\begin{gather*}\beta_0+\beta_1+\epsilon_i, \text{ if ith person has it}\\\beta_0+\epsilon_i, \text{ if ith person does not have it}\end{gather*}

$$
>[!note]
>the decision of what the numericals are allotted to the dummy variables is not a big issue, it only changes our interpretation of the coefficients. No change in regression fit.

#### Qualitative Predictors with more than 2 levels:
We just end up creating multiple dummy variables like $x_{1}, x_{2}$. Then we can use these equations to model the regression equation.

>[!important]
>There will always be 1 level with no dummy variable--> called the **BASELINE**

The p-values of the test will always be dependent on the *dummy variable* so we'll instead use the [[F-STATISTIC]] here.
