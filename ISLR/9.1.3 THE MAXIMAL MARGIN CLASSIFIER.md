### 9.1.3 THE MAXIMAL MARGIN CLASSIFIER:
>This is the seperating hyperplane that is farthest away from the training observations.

We can compute the perpendicular distance from each training observation to a given seperating hyperplane-->**MARGIN**. 
For the Maximal margin hyperplane, this margin will be the largest.

>Although it may seem very intuitive, it can lead to #overfitting when p is large.

Maximal margin hyperplane is the *mid-line* of the *widest-slab* that we can insert between 2 classes.

The closest obs which are equidistant from the mid-line are known as the *SUPPORT VECTORS.* #SupportVectors 
If these moved, then so would the line. (==check the 3 dots shown in the above figure==)

Interestingly, the maximal margin hyperplane depends directly on the support vectors, but not on the other observations: a movement to any of the other observations would not affect the separating hyperplane, provided that the observationâ€™s movement does not cause it to cross the boundary set by the margin.
