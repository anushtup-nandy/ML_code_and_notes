### 4.4.2 POISSON REGRESSION:
check out [[POISSON REGRESSION]].

We consider the following as the mean with X1,....Xp covariates.

$$
\begin{gather*}
log(\lambda(X_1,....X_p))=\beta_{0}+ \beta_{1}X_{1}+.......\beta_{p}X_{p}----(4.27) \\
or
\\
\lambda(X_1,.....,X_{p)=}e^{\beta_{0}+ \beta_{1}X_{1}+.......\beta_{p}X_{p}}----(4.28)
\end{gather*}
$$
the betas are the parameters to be estimated.

==LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION==
$$
L(\beta_0,.......,\beta_{p)=}\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{e^{-\lambda(x_i)}\lambda(x_i)^{y_i}}{y_i!}----(4.29)
$$
#### OBSERVATIONS:
- Interpretation: To interpret the coefficients in the Poisson regression model, we must pay close attention to (4.28), which states that an increase in Xj by one unit is associated with a change in E(Y ) = λ by a factor of exp(βj).
- There are no negative predictions using the Poisson regression model.
